#   TRAVIS BUILD IS DEPRECATED
#
#   WE ARE MOVING TO GH ACTIONS
#
#   PLEASE DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE ANY MORE
#
#   This file can be removed once we have enough builds with GH Actions, likely Jan'21
#   See: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2080

# Speed up build by leveraging travis caches
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.gradle/caches/
    - $HOME/.gradle/wrapper/

# Enabling container based infrastructure hoping it will help the build speed <= this didn't work well, so it's reverted
# see https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrating-from-legacy/ and https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment
